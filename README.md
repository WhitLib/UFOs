# UFOs
JavaScript, Bootstrap, and UFOs

## Overview

The purpose of this project was to build a table using data stored in a javascript array containing UFO sighting information. Because the data is so large, filters were created to make the table fully dynamic - that react to user inputs. Then, the table, along with some background information on UFO Sightings, were added to an HTML file for easy and accessible viewing.

The page was then customized using bootstrap and equipped with fully functional filters that allow users to interact with the visualizations.

## Results

When a user first navigates to the *The Truth is Out There* web page, the file should look like the below:

Once the page loads successfully, a table will appear below the *UFO Sightings: Fact or Fancy?* section. On the left, a series of filters are available to the user to filter the columns in the table on the right. The data in the table can be filtered by:

- [x] Date
- [x] City
- [x] State
- [x] Country
- [x] Shape
  
Within the table, the same columns are present as the filters with the exception of the Duration and the Comments columns added to the table view. The video snippets below shows each filter being used with values contained in the data. 

### Filter by Date

## Summary

One drawback to this table and HTML design is that the **total number of results are not displayed**. This could become problematic and frustrating for users who are filtering data and may be looking for a certain number of results and are forced to count them manually. 

Another drawback to this design is that **there are no options available when inputting data into each filter box**. For an individual who may be using this page for the first time, and is not familiar with the data, would not necessarily know what values can be used to populate data for each field.
